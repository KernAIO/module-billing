/**
 * Every migration must survive being applied twice.
 *
 * Not tidiness. `create policy` and `add constraint` have no `if not exists` at all, and
 * `create table` / `create index` do not get one by default — so a replay throws, and a module
 * migration that throws takes down the **whole host service**, not just its own module. `core`
 * hosts five.
 *
 * A replay is not hypothetical: drizzle keys applied migrations by content hash, so regenerating the
 * journal — which happens whenever somebody re-runs `db:generate` — makes every file run again
 * against a schema that already has its objects.
 *
 * Calling `migrateModule` twice does not test this. The second call reads `__migrations`, sees the
 * work is done and returns. Only replaying the SQL itself reaches the failure.
 *
 * Idempotent is also not the same as effective: a replayed `create table if not exists` reports
 * success and changes nothing, so a rewritten migration silently leaves an existing schema as it
 * was. That is a different problem and it needs `drop schema mod_billing cascade`.
